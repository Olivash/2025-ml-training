# In this README contains the instructions for running deterministic training of a data-driven weather forecasting model.

# First we need to export a SEED that controls the randomness of the training
export ANEMOI_BASE_SEED=42

# Now we start training
anemoi-training train --config-name=deterministic_minimal.yaml
