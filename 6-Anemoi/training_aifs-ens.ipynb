    "\n",
    "The **Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)** is a proper scoring rule for evaluating probabilistic forecasts. In the context of ensemble weather forecasting, CRPS training allows us to train models that produce multiple ensemble members, each representing a different possible future state of the atmosphere.\n",

    "- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Each ensemble member represents a different possible future\n",
    "- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Provides uncertainty estimates alongside predictions\n",

    "     inject_noise: True\n",
