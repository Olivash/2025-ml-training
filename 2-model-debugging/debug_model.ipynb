    "\n",
    "Validating your model is crucial to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data and does not simply memorize the training set. In this notebook, we use two main methods for model validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plotting Training and Validation Losses:**  \n",
    "    By visualizing the loss curves for both the training and validation sets over each epoch, you can monitor the learning process and detect issues such as overfitting (where validation loss increases while training loss decreases) or underfitting (both losses remain high). Consistent and decreasing validation loss indicates good generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualizing Predictions on Sample Data:**  \n",
    "    Examining a few examples from the dataset along with their predicted labels and confidence scores helps you qualitatively assess model performance. This can reveal systematic errors, misclassifications, or areas where the model is uncertain, guiding further debugging and improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extra Validation Metrics:**  \n",
    "    Calculating metrics such as accuracy per label, confusion matrices, or heatmaps provides deeper insight into model performance across different classes. These metrics help identify if the model is biased toward certain labels or struggles with specific digits, enabling targeted improvements.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we focused on improving training through hyperparameter optimization. We also fixed the issue causing very low validation accuracy. Now, we will explore the other major factor that affects model performance — the architecture. Deeper and more expressive models can capture more complex features from the data, often achieving significantly higher accuracy. For example, well-designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can reach up to 99% accuracy on MNIST-like datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What to do\n",
    "\n",
    "The original intention behind this architecture was to build upon the TinyMNISTNet model, increasing the initial number of output channels from 2 to 8, and then adding at least one additional convolutional layer to make the network deeper. The goal is to ensure that the spatial resolution is progressively reduced through the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "From 28×28 → 14×14 after the first pooling layer\n",
    "\n",
    "From 14×14 → 7×7 after the second pooling layer\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of progressive spatial compression is very common in deep learning architectures. It serves two main purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It enables the model to capture higher-level and more abstract features over larger receptive fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It reduces computational cost by operating on smaller spatial maps in deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, as we reduce spatial dimensions, we usually increase the number of feature channels (e.g., 8 → 16 → 32). This compensates for the loss of spatial information by allowing the network to represent a richer set of learned features at each level — moving from local edge or texture detection in early layers to more complex patterns and shapes in deeper ones.\n",

    "Fix the model and achieve a performance over 98%"
