Specifically, we are trying to predict the difference between station observations of 2m-temperature and the corresponding forecast prediction at the nearest gridpoint to the observation location. If we can accurately predict this difference (the forecast error) we can compensate for it, making the forecast more accurate. This type of approach is called *bias correction*, which is a form of statistical post-processing."

        "Surface observation processing refers to the process of collecting and analyzing weather observations taken at the Earth's surface by weather stations and other observing platforms. This typically includes measuring temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, and other meteorological variables. The observations are then used to produce weather forecasts and warnings, as well as to analyze and understand weather patterns. The process typically involves quality control checks to ensure the observations are accurate and reliable, as well as the use of automated systems to process and disseminate the observations in near real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning can be applied in surface observation processing in several ways. One way is to use machine learning algorithms to help improve the accuracy of forecasts by analyzing large amounts of historical weather data. The algorithms can make more accurate predictions about future weather by learning from past weather patterns. Another way machine learning can be applied is in the quality control of the observations. Machine learning models can be trained to identify and flag any observations that may be incorrect or unreliable. This quality control can help ensure that only the most accurate and reliable weather information is used for forecasts and other purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, machine learning can be used to automate the process of surface observation processing, allowing the system to run more efficiently and quickly. This can help produce forecasts and warnings more quickly and with higher accuracy, providing more detailed and accurate information to the public.\n",

Each decision tree divides the feature space into partitions and assigns a constant value, resulting in a blocky and very approximate fit - these trees are referred to as \"weak learners\". However, gradient boosting works hierarchically, such that each tree is fitted to the residuals of the ensemble of trees that came before it. By stacking many of these trees on top of each other, the result is an ensemble model that can efficiently tackle complex regression and classification problems.\n",
